# Improved Graph Convolution Network
    First Order Chebyshev Polynomial Approximation 
    Faster training
# Encoding Methods
    Extend semi-supervised learning framework to supervised learning framework
    Replacement: do not add/delete edges, only modify the weight
    Embedding: modify the weight and add/delete edges as well
